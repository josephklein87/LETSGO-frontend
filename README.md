# LETS GO APP FRONT END
created by Joe Klein

https://letsgo.herokuapp.com/

This app was created for the purpose of finding cool events in the areas of New York, Chicago and LA based on user submissions.

This is accomplished through a React front-end that interacts with a Postgres backend.

The features are as follows:

Separate page states for each city which only shows the events for that city.

The ability to save events you wish to attend to your user profile. 

Search by date.

Full CRUD functionality. City pages show tiles with low info, clicking opens a modal with full info.

## TO ADD

I would like to add the following features:

Connection to a weather API to get the days weather when you select the date.

More user filtering capability beyond just date. Filter by outdoor, indoor, dog-friendly and more. 

Separate user-page saved events by city. Only see the city you are logged into's events that you have saved and not all events.

A way to list place of interest that for the city that are not tied to a date without user submission, perhaps from an external API, though I haven't been able to find one that is free and contains the data I would like.
